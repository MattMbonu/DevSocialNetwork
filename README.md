# The Dev Network

The Dev Network is an awesome small social-network for developers I built which enables users to collaborate through posts and comments, share their professional and educational background, and even display there repositories with Github api Intergration. Feel free to make an account yourself and get connected

### Installing

Simply clone the repo and run npm install in both client and server directories

```
npm install
